# Explore the tRacket Noise Data

This folder will collect tools to help you analyze the noise data collected by tRacket devices.

## The Starter Notebook

You can use the [starter notebook](explore_noise_starter_notebook.ipynb) to dive into the data right away (if you know a bit of coding with Python). 

To run the notebook and experiment yourself:
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Select GitHub on the left panel and copy-paste the [starter notebook URL](https://github.com/CivicTechTO/tRacket-dashboard/blob/main/notebooks/explore_noise_starter_notebook.ipynb).
3. The notebook should run as is to show you how to use the dashboard utility functions to load the data and create plots.

## Loading all Data

If you are looking to dive into a deeper analysis, you can take the [load all data notebook](tracket_load_all_data.ipynb) to get all the data from all locations for a given time period.

The process is the same as above, you can run the notebook locally or on Google Colab.

## Kaggle

The tRacket project is now on Kaggle too! You can run tRacket notebooks and showcase your work. Visit us here: https://www.kaggle.com/tracketnoisesensor
