# [Dev Notes] Dashboard Application

The application runs a multi-page Plotly Dash dashboard for presenting the system level locations and per location noise measurements.

- `app.py`: main file for running the app server.
- `src/`: codebase for the data loading, app components and plotting.
- `pages/`: individual app page files.
- `tests/`: unit test.
- `assets/`: place for css, js files, favicon, embedded images - Dash will auto-load these.
